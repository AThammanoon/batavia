Artisanal Vendoring of External JS Dependencies
-----------------------------------------------

Eventually, this directory should contain git-subtree checkouts 
of the vendored repositories, and the vendored libraries would
be packaged with a real packager.

For now, all vendored libraries are processed by hand,

- copied and pasted by hand, 
- tagged with their (name: description, source URI, license),
- inserted in an IIFE to keep the global scope clean, and
- assigned to the batavia.vendored.<vendoredlibname> hierarchy 

The vendored file is in batavia/vendor/vendored.js
